# Control behavior with events

UI Toolkit provides events that communicate user actions or notifications to **visual elements**A node of a visual tree that instantiates or derives from the C# [`VisualElement`](../ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html) class. You can style the look, define the behaviour, and display it on screen as part of the UI. [More info](UIE-VisualTree.html)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#visualelement). The UI Toolkit **event system**A way of sending events to objects in the application based on input, be it keyboard, mouse, touch, or custom input. The Event System consists of a few components that work together to send events. [More info](UIE-Runtime-Event-System.html)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#EventSystem) shares the same terminology and event naming as [HTML events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events).
